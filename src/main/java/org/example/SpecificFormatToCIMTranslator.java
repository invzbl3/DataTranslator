/**
 * Step 2: Translate country-specific data to European CIM (1.12.-15.12.2023)
 * Task:
 * <p>
 * 1. Either use your own energy consumption data downloaded from Step 1 (ideally quarter-hourly format)
 * 2. Or – if you could not access it – use prepared data (provided by the lecture team on Gitlab)
 * 3. Write a translator from your specific format to the European CIM (Common Information Model) in Java
 * Make a draft code submission to Gitlab for this step (no submission in Moodle required)
 * <p>
 * Translating data from a specific format to the Common Information Model (CIM) in Java
 * typically involves creating a program or script to parse the data from your specific format
 * and then map it to the CIM format. Here's a simplified example using Java:
 * <p>
 * Please note that this is a simplified example, and you'll need to adapt it to fit the specifics of your data
 * formats, parsing logic, and CIM model structure. Additionally, you may need to use specific libraries or
 * frameworks that are compatible with your data formats and the CIM standard.
 * Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies in your project to work with the data and CIM structures.
 * <p>
 * Creating a full-fledged translator from a specific format to the European CIM in Java involves several steps.
 * The CIM is typically expressed in UML and can be serialized using various formats such as XML or RDF.
 * Below is a simplified example of a Java translator that converts a hypothetical format to the CIM in XML format.
 * Please note that this is just a basic example, and you may need to adapt it based on your specific needs and the
 * structure of your source format.

     * 1. The translateToCIM method takes the data in a specific format as input and returns the CIM data in XML
     * format. You should replace the sample translation logic with your actual conversion logic.
     * <p>
     * 2.The main method demonstrates how to use the translator. You can replace the specificFormatData variable
     * with your actual data in the specific format.
     * <p>
     * 3. Ensure that you have the necessary XML parsing libraries in your Java project.
     * If not, you may need to add dependencies like Apache Xerces or use the built-in Java XML APIs.
     * <p>
     * Remember to adapt the translation logic based on the actual structure and requirements of your specific
     * format and the CIM. Additionally, error handling and validation should be added based on your specific
     * use case.
