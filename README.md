1. Either use your own energy consumption data downloaded from Step 1 (ideally quarter-hourly format)
2. **Or – if you could not access it – use prepared data (provided by the lecture team on Gitlab)**
3. Write a translator from your specific format to the European CIM (Common Information Model) in Java
   
*Make a draft code submission to Gitlab for this step (no submission in Moodle required)*
